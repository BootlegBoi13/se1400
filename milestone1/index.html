        <h4>What Are We?</h4>
        <p>We are a non-profit website that posts the best Family Guy clips of any and all characters. We actively gather
            the best clips from every episode and add them in either a compilation or as their own clips.</p>
        <h4>What content will the site Contain?</h4>
        <p>The site will contain a wide variety of Family Guy clips, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Funny moments</li>
            <li>Character highlights</li>
            <li>Episode compilations</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Where will you get all the content for your site?</h4>
        <p>We will gather content from various sources, including:</p>

        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
        <p>We believe that Family Guy is a cultural phenomenon that deserves to be celebrated. By curating the best clips
            from the show, we aim to create a community for fans to enjoy and share their favorite moments that highlight
            the show's humor, characters, and iconic cutaways.</p>
        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
        <p>Creating a dedicated site for Family Guy clips allows fans to easily access and share their favorite moments
            because of how many clips there are. There are hundreds or thousands of clips to pick and choose from that can
            range from songs to chicken fights so I believe that this website can easily bring them all together to easily
            be found and shared fostering a sense of community and engagement around the show. It also provides a platform for
            discovering new clips and re-experiencing classic moments.</p>
        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
        <p>We would like users to explore the site, watch their favorite clips, and share their own submissions. We
            encourage community interaction through comments and discussions about the clips, as well as sharing the site
            with fellow fans.</p>
        <h4>What's the goal of this site?</h4>
        <p>The goal of this site is to create a comprehensive and easily accessible archive of the best Family Guy clips,
            fostering a community of fans who can share and celebrate their favorite moments from the show.</p>

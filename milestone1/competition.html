            <p>Here at Family Guy funny moments, we believe we are better than other accounts
                because there is no official website for this kinda thing. We believe that we are
                unique and that's what makes us special. Other accounts simply repost content without
                adding any value or curation making it harder to find certain clips, they also repost and edit the clips
                so that the original context is lost without context. We strive to create a community where fans can come
                together to enjoy and share their favorite moments from the show all in a single place. with our website
                you won't have to dig for hours searching for one video when we should be all you need. We strive to be
                fast and make it easy to find clips of your favorite moments through fan accounts where quality isn't guaranteed. We believe that by providing a dedicated platform for these clips,
                we can enhance the viewing experience and foster a deeper appreciation for the show.
